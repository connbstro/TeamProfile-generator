AS A manager I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles. In this challenge, the goal was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a team and generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries like name, email, occupation, etc for each person.
